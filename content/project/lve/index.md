SAILab Virtual Environment is a part of the Learning In Visual Environments project at SAILab (http://sailab.diism.unisi.it/lve/). 

The virtual environment is developed with Unity3D and exposes useful information for training a Visual Agents, including full pixel-wise supervisions, optical flow, and depth for each produced frame. Frames are produced at real-time speed, and are accessible through a Python API designed to easily interface with the most widely adopted Machine Learning frameworks. 

The software and source code will be soon available.
