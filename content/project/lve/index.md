SAILenv is a Virtual Environment powered by Unity3D. It includes 3 pre-built scenes with full pixel-wise annotations. SAILenv is capable of generating frames at real-time speed, complete with pixel-wise annotations, optical flow and depth.

SAILenv also comes with a Python API, designed to easily integrate with the most common learning frameworks available.

SAILenv is a running project at [SAILab](http://sailab.diism.unisi.it/). More information is available at the [project page](http://sailab.diism.unisi.it/sailenv/). Source code and executables are also available there.
