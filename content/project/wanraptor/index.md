WanRaptor is my first job as a Software Engineer and Project Manager with a big enterprise. 

The WanRaptor is an embedded system used to validate an application in a lab environment by emulating bandwidth limitations, latency, packets loss and jitter commonly found in WANs. 

The project involved the development from the ground up of the full-stack Graphical User Interface, including management of hardware resources, installation, secure licensing and user interaction.

The WanRaptor is widely used in many laboraties all over United States and further.
