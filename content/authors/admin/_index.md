I work as Lead AI Engineer at Baker Hughes, applying my strong passion and 15+ years experience with Software Engineering to Artificial Intelligence solutions for Industrial Processes. I obtained a PhD in Machine Learning and Explainable AI, at the University of Florence (Smart Computing), and performed my research work on Computer Vision, Continual Learning and Virtual Environments at SAILab at the University of Siena.
