I am a PhD student in Machine Learning and Explainable AI, at the University of Florence (Smart Computing). I make my research work at SAILab at the University of Siena. My research interests include computer vision, development of virtual environments for training of visual agents. I have a strong passion for Software Engineering and programming.
